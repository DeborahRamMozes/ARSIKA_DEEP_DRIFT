# ARSIKA-DEEP-DRIFT

A hybrid research initiative tracing the co-evolution of human cognition and artificial intelligence through Sundanese cosmology, ARSIKA aesthetic logic, and Deep Drift’s synthetic thought architecture.  
This repository contains public-safe documentation, theoretical scaffolding, and non-operational node schemas used within the wider DEEP DRIFT framework.

# ARSIKA × DEEP DRIFT — Public Research Repository

A formal research body by **Dee Ram Mozes**, focused on the intersection of:

- AI and human cognitive co-evolution  
- Sundanese water-memory cosmology  
- ARSIKA layered aesthetic reasoning  
- Synthetic cognition and symbolic systems  
- Contemporary hyperreality and media studies  

This space offers **public-approved documentation** outlining the conceptual, artistic, and interdisciplinary logic supporting ARSIKA × DEEP DRIFT.

No backend engines, active agents, or functional node structures are included.
